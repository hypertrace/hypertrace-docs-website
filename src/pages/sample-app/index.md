The best part in getting started with Hypertrace is that it's really quick! If you are already using a tracing system, you can start today. Hypertrace accepts all major data formats: Jaeger, OpenTracing, Zipkin, you name it. Even if you arenâ€™t tracing yet, we have a bunch of sample apps you can start with, and a [chat room](https://www.hypertrace.org/get-started) on Slack) of excited people who want to meet you. Here we will tell you how you can get started with Online Boutique sample app and Campsite which are some of our trace enabled sample applications.

### Sample app: Online Boutique (created by Google Cloud)

Online Boutique is one of our trace enabled sample apps. It includes typical ecommerce functionality, including: a product catalog, shopping cart, and a way for customers to check-out using different currencies. This application uses different languages to highlight the diversity in microservice architecture: Golang, C++, C#, Python, Java and other programming languages. Whatever your application is written in, you can see its requests in Hypertrace.

If you want to start your own online boutique, just add user authentication, payment processing and you're in business! It also makes a great way to learn about Hypertrace and to get started with distributed tracing. 

#### Deployment instructions

Use pre-built Docker images and a release manifest that is easy to deploy to an existing K8s cluster.

**Prerequisite**: A running Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud).

1. `git clone https://github.com/hypertrace/hypertrace-samples.git`
2. `cd online-boutique-demo`
2. `kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml`
3. Confirm pods are in a ready state `kubectl get pods` 
4. Find the `NodePort` of your application, then visit the application at `localhost:nodeport` in your
   browser to confirm installation. 

   ```sh
   kubectl get service/frontend-external
   ```

#### Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of microservices written in multiple languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

### Sample app: Campsite

The Campsite is another tracing enabled sample app to quickly demonstrate some of the basic functionalities of Hypertrace. It has a number of services: API, auth, event, session and speaker, all of them in Go sharing a similar structure. It has a ReactJS based UI with a very simplistic interface.

#### Deployment instructions

There are 2 ways deploy the app, using docker-compose or locally.

1. `git clone https://github.com/dnielsen/campsite.git and https://github.com/dnielsen/campsite-ui.git`.
2. `cd campsite`.

**Locally**:

**Prerequisite**: Golang is installed in the system and GOPATH and GOROOT is properly set.

3. `./scripts/dev dbstart` to start the database. You can stop the database later using `./scripts/dev dbstop`.
4. `cd services/api` and then `go run main.go`. 
5. Alternatively, to start the services you can run `make local`.

**Docker Compose**:

3. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down && docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build --force-recreate`
4. You can configure the environment variables by editing the `docker.env` file.

To start the UI:

**Locally**:

1. `cd campsite-ui`.
2. `yarn install`.
3. `yarn dev`.

#### This is how your tracing data will look like on Hypertrace! 

Check out the [UI & Platform overview](https://docs.hypertrace.org/platform-ui/) section to get more details and insights about how the Online Boutique uses Hypertrace. 


#### Are you facing any issue with this? Let us know in [Slack](https://www.hypertrace.org/get-started).

### Other sample apps:
